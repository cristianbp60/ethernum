### Pre-requisites

Before beginning, ensure that you have set up your local environment according to the instructions provided in
[sdk/README.md](../sdk/readme.md). This client utilizes both the Bun package manager and the SDK packages.

For this to work correctly you will need to have katana running with the deployed contracts - this is easy!
