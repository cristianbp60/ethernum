# Realms: Eternum

Eternum serves as one of the pioneering nodes in the Realms Autonomous World, constructed atop the [dojo](https://github.com/dojoengine/dojo) platform. Its primary objective is to establish the foundational economic layer of the Realms Autonomous World, with its structure built around the original Realm NFTs.

Eternum represents an ambitious endeavor to forge an open and composable world, one that is collectively owned and governed by its user community. More than just a collection, Eternum encompasses a suite of smart contracts, crafted to be both composable and extensible. These contracts are not only designed to be utilized by various other contracts and applications but also to encourage a versatile and innovative ecosystem.

As a developer you could deploy a set of systems in this world and ecourage players to use these systems, and in the process earn a small fee in resources or the native token lords.

## What Does 'Open' Truly Signify?

When we pronounce this world as 'open,' we imply that literally anyone has the capability to deploy a dojo system into this world - this is the idea of a true autonomous world. This can extend its functionality or even alter its governing rules. For a deeper dive into its mechanics and philosophies, please explore the dojo book.

## Eternum is Headless

The client in this repository serves merely as a reference implementation of a client and is not a prerequisite for using Eternum. We advocate for the creation of alternative clients, providing a diverse range of ways to interact with the contracts. Utilization of Eternum does not mandate the use of a specific client. Engage with the client of your preference, or interact with the contracts directly if so desired.

## Roadmap

Outlined below are the high-level objectives for Eternum, though they are subject to modification:

1. [x] Trading and Hyperstructures
2. [ ] Banking
3. [ ] Combat
4. [ ] World Governance

## Getting Started

You will need an understanding of the [dojo](https://book.dojoengine.org) and react.

- Additional resources outside Eternums
