1. starknet usernames should be free and given immediately you get a wallet address
2. wallet addresses are bad. everyone should use usernames

3. onboarding is a burden.
    . users don't want private keys for simple transactions with hot wallets.
    . when the user is being onboarded, we store the private keys. 
    . whenever they like, they can assign a master account that can do anything on this account,
        including stopping us from doing any command
    . 
4.  a. so users come
    b. they enter a username and password
    c. they create a wallet. 
    d. to connect the wallet, we partner with apps to use oauth2
    e. the app itself has its own wallet disconnected from the main wallet. 
        then users can [approve] the apps to carry out certain transactions

        how will approval work since users do not primarily understand what a transaction means?
        what is acceptable in order payment systems that should be acceptable here?

        how will gas be paid? by the main account calling transactions through the app account


        it's very important that the wallet is controlled by the app and not the user.
        that leaves room for breach of trust but it's the same with traditional apps

        what about a saas for storing passwords and returning encrypted private keys for apps to use
